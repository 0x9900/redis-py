This is the Python interface to the Redis key-value store.

The Redis API, which redis-py is derived from can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference

redis-py is developed and maintained by Andy McCurdy (sedrik@gmail.com).
It can be found here: http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py

Special thanks to:

* Ludovico Magnocavallo, author of the original Python Redis client, from
  which some of the socket code is still used.
* Alexander Solovyov for ideas on the generic response callback system.
* Paul Hubbard for initial packaging support.
